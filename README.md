# Book_Search

## My Task
Your assignment this week is emblematic of the fact that most modern websites are driven by two things: data and user demands. This shouldn't come as a surprise, as the ability to personalize user data is the cornerstone of real-world web development today. And as user demands evolve, applications need to be more performant.
This week, you’ll take starter code with a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. It's already set up to allow users to save book searches to the back end.

## Installation
The user will need to have React, Axios, NodeJS, ExpressJS, Serve and Heroku. Dependencies are listed in package.json. To run the app, go inside Client directory and run npm run build. Be sure to npm i to install all dependencies!
